# cs6440-project
### Note
In addition to the Synthea generated CSVs in this repo, we also used this dataset from Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset?resource=download](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset?resource=download)

### Run application locally
1. Clone the repo and go to your terminal
2. Make sure you are in the project-ui folder
3. Create a virtual environment in your IDE and ensure that it uses the `requirements.txt` file
4. Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
5. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run `ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json`
7. Open the `python_api.py` script, right-click and run
8. Open your browser and go to the `localhost` that the Angular application has opened on (most likely 4200, but check your first terminal tab to make sure)
